# Seed Count Performance Analysis

A comprehensive analysis tool that compares the performance of different influence maximization methods based on the number of seed nodes selected.

## üéØ Purpose

This analysis answers critical questions about influence maximization:
- **How does performance scale with the number of seeds?**
- **Which method performs best for different seed counts?**
- **How much marginal gain do additional seeds provide?**
- **How similar are the seed selections between different methods?**

## üìä Analysis Overview

### **Seed Counts Analyzed**
- **k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5**: Small seed sets (typical for viral marketing)
- **k = 10, 15, 20, 25**: Larger seed sets (campaign optimization)

### **Methods Compared**
1. **Greedy Algorithm**: Optimal but computationally expensive
2. **TDA (Topological Data Analysis)**: Novel topological approach
3. **Degree Centrality**: Fast heuristic based on node degrees
4. **Betweenness Centrality**: Fast heuristic based on node betweenness

### **Networks Tested**
- **Erd≈ës-R√©nyi**: Random networks
- **Barab√°si-Albert**: Scale-free networks
- **Watts-Strogatz**: Small-world networks
- **Community**: Networks with community structure
- **Scale-Free**: Power-law degree distribution
- **Bridge Network**: Networks with low-degree bridge nodes

## üöÄ Usage

### **Basic Usage**

```bash
python seed_analysis.py
```

This will:
1. Generate 6 different network types
2. Select seeds for all methods (up to 25 seeds)
3. Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations for each seed count
4. Generate comprehensive visualizations
5. Provide detailed performance analysis

### **Parameters**

You can modify these parameters in the script:

```python
NUM_NODES = 100                    # Number of nodes in networks
SEED_COUNTS = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]  # Seed counts to analyze
MC_SIMULATIONS = 100               # Monte Carlo simulations per configuration
```

## üìà Analysis Process

### **Step 1: Seed Selection**
- Run each method to select up to 25 seeds
- Store the complete ordered list of selected seeds
- This ensures fair comparison across different seed counts

### **Step 2: Performance Evaluation**
- For each seed count k, take the top k seeds from each method
- Run 100 Monte Carlo simulations for each configuration
- Calculate average influence spread and standard deviation

### **Step 3: Analysis & Visualization**
- Generate performance comparison plots
- Analyze seed selection overlap between methods
- Provide detailed statistical summaries

\begin{abstract}
  When humans are subject to an algorithmic decision system, they can strategically adjust their behavior accordingly (``game'' the system). 
  While a growing line of literature on strategic classification has used game-theoretic modeling to understand and mitigate such gaming, these existing works commonly consider standard models of \emph{fully rational} agents. 
  In this paper, we propose a strategic classification model that considers \emph{behavioral biases} in human responses to algorithms. We show how misperceptions of a classifier (specifically, of its feature weights) can lead to different types of discrepancies between biased and rational agents' responses, and identify when behavioral agents over- or under-invest in different features. We also show that strategic agents with behavioral biases can benefit or (perhaps, unexpectedly) harm the firm compared to fully rational strategic agents. We complement our analytical results with user studies, which support our hypothesis of behavioral biases in human responses to the algorithm. Together, our findings highlight the need to account for human (cognitive) biases when designing AI systems, and providing explanations of them, to strategic human in the loop.

% \section{Rights Information}

% Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
% form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
% made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
% license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

% Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
% copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
% form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
% document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
% their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
% document:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
% \item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
% \item the conference information in the page header(s).
% \end{itemize}

% Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
% works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
% each of the works.

% The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
% page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

% \section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

% Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
% taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
% search.

% The ACM Computing Classification System ---
% \url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
% classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
% discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
% system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
% commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

% User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
% of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
% the research being presented.

% CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
% articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
% two-page articles (or abstracts).




% \section{Citations and Bibliographies}

% The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
% references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
% --- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
% (``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
% reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
% article DOI, etc.

% The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
% commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
%   \bibliography{bibfile}
% \end{verbatim}
% where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
% suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

% Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
% ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
% ``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
% command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
% ``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
% \begin{verbatim}
%   \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
% \end{verbatim}


%   Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
%   enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
%   issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
%   monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
%   \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
%   \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
%   the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
%   Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
%   a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
%   divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
%   book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
%   conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
%   article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
%   all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
%   proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
%   \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
%     AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
%   master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
%   resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
%   (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
%   and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
%   publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
%   \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
%   contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
%   \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:
%   multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536} and \cite{MR781537}. A
%   couple of citations with DOIs:
%   \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Online

% during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
% consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

% Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

% \section{Appendices}

% If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
% ``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
% document.

% \end{verbatim}
% and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
% numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
% and subsection identification method.

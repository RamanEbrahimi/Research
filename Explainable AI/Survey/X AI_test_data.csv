This study is being done by Parinaz Naghizadeh, Kristen Vaccaro, and Raman Ebrahimi from UC San Diego. You were selected to participate in this study because you are above 18, speak English, and are a United States resident. 
The purpose of this research study is to measure the benefits (e.g., how much someone can learn) of XAI explanations as well as costs (e.g., how much someone can game the system with information from an explanation) of XAI explanations. Your participation in this research should last approximately 5 minutes for survey, and 30 minutes for the interview. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be either asked to do an online task and fill out a survey about understanding, trust, and satisfaction related to the tool used in the task, or a few interview questions about explanations of a machine learning algorithm. 
Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. You are free to skip any question that you choose. 
If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Raman Ebrahimi +1-614-390-4131. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777. IRB #810577
